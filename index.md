# DEF CON Group Paris

Welcome lovely hackers. We did this website to push news and more infos about the meetup, the team and our guests. This DCG is mostly an IRL community, but you’ll also find a Slack Channel to get in touch with people you met at the meetup.

We invite you to read our Code of Conduct, in French.

Feel free to ask us any questions via email or Twitter.

See you soon!
