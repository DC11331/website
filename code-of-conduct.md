We meet in a public area or private area. Nobody is excluded. There is no admission charge or dues of any sort. It’s preferable to have meetings in as open a spot as possible rather than behind closed doors. This ensures that new people who don’t know about the meetings will be drawn in. We have nothing to hide and we don’t presume to judge who is worthy of attending and who is not.

We act in a responsible manner. We don’t do illegal things and we don’t cause problems for the place we’re meeting in. DC11331 meetings are welcomed by the establishments we choose.

If there is any issues, don't hesite to bring the matters to the organiser of the day.
