# About

We hold a monthly meeting the last Thursday of every month We have two entry level quick security talks to start. We network with the people that are attending conferences in Europe and visiting us in Paris. You’ll find a crypto and SE challenge – the first ones to beat it gets a free beer. Most of the time there is a bit of lockpicking, bring your stuff. CFP for the meetup is open, send us an email at dcgroupparis@gmail.com if you want to give a talk (fr or eng).
